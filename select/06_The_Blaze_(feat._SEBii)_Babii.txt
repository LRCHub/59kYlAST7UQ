I wanna pop like a popstar
Goin' so fast like a cop car
Flight school boy, I like that part
Collect these stars like Mario Kart
I'mma hit this like playing darts
It's crazy that this is just the start
Hair so spiky like I'm Bart
Got it all
(All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all)

My pockets right now, they're so tight
I be going up, they wanna be my wife
I'm the white and shinin' armor, like a knight
Look up in the sky, starry night
So many bright lights
Shit, I could touch the sky (Sky)
[?]

What you say, I don't give a shit
I got diamonds on my neck
Yeah, it feels so wet (Uh)
Got armor on my chest
Yeah, I get higher every step
Yeah, I get wiser every neck
Grew up on the World Wide Web
Without the internet I'd be dead

I like it, I want it, I don't really care if it's toxic
I like it, I want it, I don't really care 'bout if it's toxic
I like it, I want it, I don't really care 'bout if it's toxic
Toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic
Check out the bands on my body, they're so cold
She wanna be my shawty, 'cause I'm so cold
ASAP, no Rocky, yeah, 'cause this is my world

Cold, so cold (Cold, cold)
Tell me the rule (Rule)
Cold (Cold)
Fall (Fall)
And I'm right (Cold)
You only need it one time to live it up (Stop, cold)
You only need it one time to live it up (Cold, cold)
If I like it I'mma take it
